                    <p>
                        This PostgreSQL database was my term project for CS669
                        at Boston University. I built it with the idea that it
                        could be used for a fitness and nutrition
                        tracking app. With this database, an app could store
                        data about users' workouts, food eaten, and so on, and
                        query for statistics for both. Included in
                        the script are queries to populate all tables, stored
                        procedures to apply transactions like creating a new
                        template entry and associating a template with a users,
                        and triggers for updating a users' personal bests and
                        logging a
                        password change by a user. Additionally, I've also
                        included some sample queries for common user actions,
                        such as querying for average meal macronutrients:
                    </p>

                        which gives us the following the average macronutrient
                        breakdown for a week of eating for a given user:

                        This was a group project, completed with another
                        student, as the final project of CIT594 at The
                        University of Pennsylvania, It utilizes a rudimentary
                        MVC pattern where the model accepts either a JSON or CSV
                        file of tabular data and parses it into various data
                        structures, while the view provides the user with a CLI
                        menu consisting of multiple data analysis functions. The
                        controller of course acts as the go-between for the
                        model and view, but also provides validation for
                        incoming files before passing them to the model.

                    <p>
                        Additionally, we implemented a logger using the
                        singleton pattern, which logs all user interactions with
                        the program, and
                        built a finite state machine to parse incoming csv files
                        (JSON files were parsed with Java's existing JSON
                        library).

                        In this project, I analyzed two datasets using Python
                        and Pandas in Jupyter Notebook. Both datasets consisted
                        of employee exit surveys and were obtained from the
                        Department of Education, Training, and
                        Employment; and from the Technical and Further Education
                        Institute, both in Queensland, Autralia. Each contained
                        various data points about employees such as employee id
                        and start and end dates, as well as information about
                        why employees left their positions
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The project consisted of cleaning the data to deal with
                        null values and odd entries, as well as getting both
                        sets into workable shape. Then basic analysis to
                        determine why employees left their positions, if it
                        differed between short- and long-term employees, and how
                        much of a role job dissatisfaction played in their
                        leaving.
