            Hi, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Joshua
            Byrd, and I am currently a master's candidate in the MSSD program at
            Boston University's Metropolitan College. I have taken classes in
            introductory software development, computer systems and systems
            programming, data structures and algorithms, and database design
            with PostgreSQL. Currently, I am studying front-end web development.

          <h2>The Long Story (AKA, How did I get here?)</h2>
          <p>
            As I mentioned, I'm working on a master's degree in software
            development. However, I am probably not what you picture when you
            imagine a STEM student.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the first fifteen or so years of my career doing tradeswork
            -
            residential construction and facilities maintenance mostly, but I've
            done a little bit of everything in and around a job site.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>None of this was my dream career.</em>

            In fact, I've pretty much always known that I wanted to be a
            software
            engineer, but life, as it frequently does, had other plans. A few
            years ago I decided to go back to school to try to make that dream a
            reality. My academic career to that point was unremarkable, so a
            proper computer science program was out of the question. Still, I
            believed I could get there, even if I had to take the roundabout way
            to do it. After three years of hard work, I
            completed a Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies degree at West
            Virginia University, graduating with a 4.0 GPA. My final year, I
            taught myself to code in Python and built a small portfolio of
            projects. Soon after, I was accepted into The University of
            Pennsylvania's Master of Computer and Information Technology
            program.
            Touted as a CS program for those without CS background, MCIT was my
            first real introduction to the world of programming and computer
            science.

            <em>But, again, life had other plans.</em>

            A few weeks into my first semester at UPenn, my two-year-old son was
            diagnosed with acute lymphblastic leukemia - ALL, for short. As
            devastating as the news was, we were fortunate: ALL is extremely
            treatable. It did, however, mean a nearly three-year treatment
            period,
            consisting of weekly (and eventually at-home) chemotherapy
            treatments.
            I took a formal leave of absence from school, and taking care of my
            son became my full-time job.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six months into my son's treatment, I returned to school part-time,
            splitting my time between caring for him and trying to keep up with
            UPenn's demanding expectations. I did that for two years, and made
            it
            through the core CS classes, maintaining a 3.72 GPA. But I was
            stressed to the breaking point. After a second leave of absence due
            to
            my son being hospitalized for a bacterial infection, I knew that
            didn't want to return to UPenn. I wanted more practical work, and
            less theory, to be challenged without feeling like I wanted to jump
            off a bridge around mid-terms. So I began looking at software
            development/engineering degrees instead.

            A few months ago, my son completed his treatment, and I transferred
            to
            Boston University into the MSSD program. Aside from BU's excellent
            reputation, I was impressed by their curriculum - classes in web
            development, mobile applications, agile methodology. All things that
            would be invaluable to a career-changer like myself. Although this
            is my first semester, I feel very strongly that I made a great
            choice with BU. I know that the skills
            I'm learning will have immediate transfer, letting me hit the ground
            running when I find my first position. And while the University of
            Pennsylvania is obviously a great school, I know that it wasn't
            right for me at this time in my life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I know that I have a lot to learn, and that the learning
            journey will never truly stop, I believe that I have the skills,
            drive, and curiosity to be a great software engineer. If you'd like
            to
            join me on this journey, please check out my blog, where I plan to
            document everything, or the projects section where I highlight what
            I've built or am currently working on.
