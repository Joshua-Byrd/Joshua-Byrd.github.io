          <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Josh, and as it says
            on the main page, I'm currently a master's candidate in the MSSD
            program at Boston University. However, I am probably not what you
            picture when you
            imagine a STEM student. I spent the first fifteen or so years of my
            career doing tradeswork - residential construction and facilities
            maintenance mostly, but I've done a little bit of everything in and
            around a job site.This was
            <b>not</b> my dream career.

              In truth, I've pretty much always known that I wanted to be a
              software engineer, but life, as it frequently does, had other
              plans,
              and I did what I needed to to take care of my family. A few
              years ago I decided to go back to school to try to make that dream
              a
              reality. My academic career to that point was unremarkable, so a
              proper computer science program was out of the question. Still, I
              believed I could get there, even if I had to take the roundabout
              way
              to do it.
            </p>
            <p>
              After three years of hard work, I completed a Bachelor of
              Multidisciplinary Studies degree at West Virginia University,
              graduating with a 4.0 GPA. My final year, I taught myself to code
              in
              Python and built a small portfolio of projects. Soon after, I was
              accepted into The University of Pennsylvania's Master of Computer
              and Information Technology program. Touted as a CS program for
              those
              without a CS background, MCIT was my first real introduction to
              the
              world of programming and computer
              science.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once again, life had other plans.
            </p>
            <p>
              A few weeks into my first semester at UPenn, my two-year-old son
              was
              diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or, ALL, for
              short. No one ever wants to hear a cancer diagnosis, but we were
              fortunate: ALL is extremely treatable and has a very high survival
              rate. It did, however, mean a nearly three-year treatment
              period, consisting of weekly (and sometimes more than weekly)
              trips
              to the oncologist for chemotherapy
              treatments and all the other fun things that accompany cancer
              treatment like hair loss, daily vomiting, and at-home injections.
              So, I took a formal leave of absence from school, and
              taking
              care of my son became my full-time job.
            </p>
            <p>
              Six months into my son's treatment, I returned to school
              part-time,
              splitting my time between caring for him and trying to keep up
              with
              UPenn's demanding expectations. I did that for two years, and made
              it through the core CS classes, maintaining a 3.72 GPA. But I was
              stressed to the breaking point. After a second leave of absence
              due
              to my son being hospitalized for a bacterial infection, I knew
              that
              didn't want to return to UPenn. I wanted more practical work, and
              less theory, to be challenged without feeling like I wanted to
              jump
              off a bridge around mid-terms. So I began looking at software
              development/engineering degrees instead.

            <p>
              A few months ago, my son completed his treatment, and I
              transferred
              to Boston University into the MSSD program. Aside from BU's
              excellent reputation, I was impressed by their curriculum -
              classes
              in web development, mobile applications, agile methodology. All
              things that would be invaluable to a career-changer like myself.
              Although this is my first semester, I feel very strongly that I
              made
              a great
              choice with BU. I know that the skills
              I'm learning will have immediate transfer, letting me hit the
              ground
              running when I find my first position. And while the University of
              Pennsylvania is obviously a great school, I know that it wasn't
              right for me at this time in my life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I know that I have a lot to learn, and that the learning
              will never truly stop, I believe that I have the skills,
              drive, and curiosity to be a great software engineer. If you'd
              like
              to join me, please check out my blog, where I plan to document the
              journey from maintenance man to software engineer, or the projects
              section where I highlight what I've built or am currently working
              on.
