        <p>
          Hello, everyone, and welcome to my portfolio. My name is Joshua Byrd,
          and I am currently a master's candidate in the MSSD program at Boston
          University's Metropolitan College. I have taken classes in
          introductory software development, computer systems and systems
          programming, data structures and algorithms, and database design with
          PostgreSQL. Currently I am studying front-end web development.

          As I mentioned, I'm working on a master's degree in software
          development. However, I am probably not what you picture when you
          imagine a STEM student.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the first fifteen or so years of my career doing tradeswork -
          residential construction and facilities maintenance mostly, but I've
          done a little bit of everything in and around a job site.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>None of this was my dream career.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, I've pretty much always known that I wanted to be a software
          engineer, but life, as it frequently does, had other plans. A few
          years ago I decided to go back to school to try to make that dream a
          reality. My academic career to that point was unremarkable, so a
          proper computer science program was out of the question. Still, I knew
          I could get there eventually. After three years of hard work, I
          completed a Bachelor of Multidisciplinary Studies degree at West
          Virginia University, graduating with a 4.0 GPA. My final year, I
          taught myself to code in Python and built a small portfolio of
          projects. Soon after, I was accepted into The University of
          Pennsylvania's Master of Computer and Information Technology program.
          Touted as a CS program for those without CS background, MCIT was my
          first real introduction to the world of programming and computer science.

          <em>But, again, life had other plans.</em>
        </p>

          A few weeks into my first semester at UPenn, my two-year-old son was
          diagnosed with acute lymphblastic leukemia - ALL, for short. As
          devastating as the news was, we were fortunate: ALL is extremely
          treatable. It did, however, mean a nearly three-year treatment period,
          consisting of weekly (and eventually at-home) chemotherapy treatments.
          I took a formal leave of absence from school, and taking care of my
          son became my full-time job.
        </p>

          </blockquote>
        </aside>
        <p>
          Six months into my son's treatment, I returned to school part-time,
          splitting my time between caring for him and trying to keep up with
          UPenn's demanding expectations. I did that for two years, and made it
          through the core CS classes, maintaining a 3.72 GPA. But I was
          stressed to the breaking point. After a second leave of absence due to
          my son being hospitalized for a bacterial infection, I knew that didn't want to return to UPenn. I wanted more practical work, and less theory, to be challenged without feeling like I wanted to jump off a bridge around mid-terms. So I began looking at software development/engineering degrees instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few months ago, my son completed his treatment, and I transferred to
          Boston University into the MSSD program. Aside from BU's excellent reputation, I was impressed by their curriculum - classes in web development, mobile applications, agile methodology. All things that would be invaluable to a career-changer like myself. Although this is my first semester, I feel very strongly that I made a great choice with BU. I know that the skills
          I'm learning will have immediate transfer, letting me hit the ground
          running when I find my first position. And while the University of Pennsylvania is obviously a great school, I know that it wasn't right for me at this time in my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although I know that I have a lot to learn, and that the learning
          journey will never truly stop, I believe that I have the skills,
          drive, and curiosity to be a great software engineer. If you'd like to
          join me on this journey, please check out my blog, where I plan to
          document everything, or the projects section where I highlight what
          I've built or am currently working on.
