# CS601 Term Project 
## Joshua Byrd

The goal of this project was to create a strong portfolio website that both adhered to the requirements of the final project of CS601 and showcased my skills and education to potential employers. 

My site currently has seven pages: 
1. A landing page featuring reveal-on-scroll links to the rest of the site. 
2. A page consisting of my current resumt in HTML.
3. A projects page built in Vue.js with links to several of my academic projects on Github.
4. A blog that features accordion style revealing/hiding posts.
5. A gallery of images.
6. An 'About Me' page detailing my personl bio.
7. A contact page with a contact form and links to my Github and LinkedIn accounts. 

My website utilizes flexbox or grid on every page to be completely responsive, and works well on screen sizes from mobile to extra large desktop monitors. JavaScript is utilized throughout to create attractive and interesting features, and readability and usability have been taken into account in all aspects of it.  I'm proud of this site and the work that went into it, and I believe that it demonstrates a strong working knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and ES6 and beyond JavaScript.
