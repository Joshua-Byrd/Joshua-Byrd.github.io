# Purpose

This porfolio site was my term project for CS601 at Boston University's Metropolitan College. It consists primarily of HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, although Vue.js was used to create the projects page, as that was a requirement for the project. I wanted to be able to use this as a real portfolio, so the bio and resume pages are true and accurate, and that project page contains links to real projects I have worked on. Additionally, the contact page links to my real LinkedIn and Github pages, and the form can be used to contact me directly.

# Site

The website is hosted on Github pages, and can be accessed here: https://joshua-byrd.github.io/
