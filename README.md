# CS601 Assignment 2

For this assignment, I have styled nearly every element on every page using CSS. Per the assignment instructions, I've applied a consistent style and feel across all pages, utilizing a specifically chosen color palette and fonts (these can be found at the top of the main CSS file). I've also made the pages responsive using reasonable breakpoints (also found at the top of the CSS file) to resize main elements like h1s. 

## Above and Beyond
In addition to the base requirements, I have added the following features:
1. a navbar that is responsive and reactive using flexbox. On hover, menu links change for both visual appeal and feedback to the user (this is true of all links, but standard links are styled differently).  Additionally, the navbar collapses to become columnar as the screen approaches mobile size. 
2. a gallery page that utilizes flexbox to create a responsive, attractive gallery of images. Additionally, using transform and transitions, the images resize on hover.
3. a proper contact page containing a working contact form using Formspree. It is also responsive, using flexbox to collapse the two columns into a single column.  
4. a basic version of the site for printing using a media query
5. a new blog post, about the transform: rotate property.
6. the site has now been published to Github pages and can be found at https://joshua-byrd.github.io/

## Plans for the final project
For the final project, I plan to add a resume page and remove the main points section from the 'About' page. Separating these seems a better solution, and gets me to the 7-page minimum. I'd like to add more pages, but I'm not sure what yet. I also want to redesign the projects page, codensing each project and arranging them in two or three columns. 

I still need something eye-catching for the landing page, but I've been at kind of a loss there. Over the next couple of weeks, I plan to research other portfolio sites to get some ideas.

## Problems/issues
As far as I know, every things works on the site the way that it's supposed to. The only issue that I've run into is trying to center the code screenshots on the blog page. I've tried numerous ways to target them, and they always end up left justified. It doesn't look bad, exactly, but it's frustrating. 

# CS601 Assignment 1

For this first iteration of our term project, I have created the basic structure for a portfolio site in HTML. Currently the site consists of five pages: 

1. A main landing page, on which I hope to eventually place an eye-catching feature to hook the viewer as the course (and my own skill) progresses.
2. An 'about me' page, which consists of two main sections. The first section will serve as a shortened resume of sorts, highlighting particular skills or proficiencies at a glance. The second section will be a longer biography. As the project progresses, I separate these into a resume and an about page.
3. A blog page, chronicling the things that we are learning. As the site progresses, my hope is that this will demonstrate to a future potential employer that I've truly learned and put into practice the concepts in the course, rather than simply copy/pasting from Stack Overflow or the like.
4. A projects page linking to specific projects that I've done. Each project will have a description, perhaps a small screenshot or illustration, and a link to the Github page of that project.
5. A contact page with links to my email, Github, and LinkedIn page. In the future, this could also include a form for potential employers to contact me about a needed project, estimates, and so on. 

Although we are limited in this assignment by the lack of CSS and JavaScript, I have tried to make this as much a 'real' site as possible, adding multiple actual posts to the blog page and telling my story as middle-aged worker returning to school on the About page. I've also gone beyond the base requirements in multiple ways, such as researching the \<pre\> and \<code\> tags to add formatted code to the blog and project pages, including numerous semantic elements on every page, and adding additional pages and text. 

## To Run

As this is current a static website, no extra steps are necessary to run it. Simply open index.html in your browser of choice.
