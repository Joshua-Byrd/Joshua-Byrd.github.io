# CS601 Assignment 1

For this first iteration of our term project, I have created the basic structure for a portfolio site in HTML.  Currently the site consists of five pages: 

1. A main landing page, on which I hope to eventually place an eye-catching feature to hook the viewer as the course, and my own skill, progresses.
2. An 'about me' page, which consists of two main sections. The first section will serve as a shortened resume of sorts, highlighting particular skills or proficiencies at a glance. The second section will be a longer biography.
3. A blog page, chronicling the things that we are learning. As the site progresses, I hope that this will demonstrate that I've truly learned and put into practice the concepts in the course, rather than simply copy/pasting from somewhere 
4. A projects page linking to specific projects that I've done. Each project will have a description, perhaps a small screenshot or illustration, and a link to the Github page of that project.
5. A contact page with links to my email, Github, and LinkedIn page. In the future, this could also include a form for potential employers to contact me about a needed project, estimates, and so on. 

As this is current a static website, no extra steps are necessary to run it. Simply open index.html in your browser of choice.
