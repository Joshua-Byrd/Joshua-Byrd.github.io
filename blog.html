            <h2>11/04/23 - Tables</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            To display tabular data, such as you might find in an excel
            spreadsheet or Pandas dataframe, in HTML, we use (shockingly) a
            table.
          </p>
          <p>
            Enclosed within the &lt;table&gt; tag, we define headers with the
            table header tag &lt;th&gt;, ordinary rows with table rows
            &lt;tr&gt;, and cell values with &lt;td&gt; (table data).
          </p>
          <p>
            For instance, let's say we wanted to display some current stock
            market information. We could use the following code:
          </p>
          <img class="code-screenshots"
            src="./images/table_code_screenshot.png"
            alt="a screenshot of the code for an HTML table.">
          <p>
            Which gives us the following table:
          </p>
          <table>
            <tr>
              <th></th>
              <th></th>
              <th>Change</th>
              <th>PCT Change</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>DOW</td>
              <td>12,189.14</td>
              <td>-152.69</td>
              <td>-1.24%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>S&P 500</td>
              <td>1,305.75</td>
              <td>-13.93</td>
              <td>-1.06%</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>NASDAQ</td>
              <td>2,731.64</td>
              <td>-33.01</td>
              <td>-1.19%</td>
            </tr>
          </table>
          <p>
            A couple of things to to note here. First, table data &lt;td&gt; is
            nested within each table row &lt;tr&gt;, which is nested with the
            table tags. And second, our top row is defined not with table data
            tags, but with table header tags &lt;th&gt;. Also, notice that there
            are two empty header tags. As headers are aligned with columns, we
            need those there to make sure the change and PCT change headers are
            place over the appropriate columns.
          </p>

            <h2>11/02/23 - Audio and Video in HTML5</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            One of the main topics covered this week is the addition of audio
            and
            video files into web pages. As common as multimedia is on the modern
            web, it's not as simple as adding an &lt;img&gt; tag for images.
            First, not all browsers support the same
            <a
              href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/codec">codecs</a>,
            so it becomes necessary to provide multiple file types(e.g. having
            a video file provided in both .mp4 and .webm). Additionally, since
            some older browsers don't support HTML5, which introduces native
            multimedia, we must also add an error message for this scenario. So,
            beginning with the base &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; tags, this
            ends up looking something like this:
          </p>

          <img class="code-screenshots"
            src="./images/audio_video_screenshot.png"
            alt="A screenshot of the code for HTML5 audio and video.">

          <p>Which gives us this:</p>
          <audio controls>
            <source src="./audio/viper.mp3">
            <source src="./audio/viper.ogg">
            Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.
          </audio>
          <video preload controls>
            <source src="./video/rabbit320.mp4">
            <source src="./video/rabbit320.webm">
            Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.
          </video>

          <p>
            Note also the attribute used: <em>controls</em> tells the browser to
            render the controls for the file. Control buttons are not displayed
            by
            default, so this attribute is necessary for the user to be able to
            play or stop the playback. Other attributes include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              autoplay - applies to both video an audio and indicates that the
              file shoule start playing automatically.
            </li>
            <li>
              preload - applies to both video and audio and inidcates what the
              browser should do if autoplay is not enabled. It can take the
              following values:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  none - browser should not load the file until the user presses
                  play
                </li>
                <li>auto - browser downloads the video when the page loads</li>
                <li>
                  metadata - browser collects metadata like size, duration and
                  track list
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              width and height - determines the size that a video is rendered in
              the browser.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>

            <h2>11/01/23 - A New Adventure</h2>
          </header>
          <p>
            I've considered starting a blog numerous times in the past. I love
            to
            write (so much so that I did a completely useless professional
            writing
            minor in undergrad), but I've never quite been able to muster the
            discipline to do it regularly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, taking a front-end web development course, we are tasked with
            creating a portfolio site as a term project, which seems to me to be
            the perfect impetus to actually get it together and do this thing.
            So,
            I'm setting the following goal:
            <i>With each assignment (each iteration of the project), I will add
              at
              least one blog post highlighting something that I've learned
              within
              that module.</i>
            Realistically, I'll probably cut myself some slack as finals
            approach, though.
          </p>
          <p>Time to get to work!</p>
