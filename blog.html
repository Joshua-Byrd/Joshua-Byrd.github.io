                                This deserves a longer explanation, and I
                                will get to that, but
                                between my current homework, creating this
                                post, adding to the final
                                project (note the new resume page), and
                                trying to cover the reading
                                for next week...I'm kind of pressed for
                                time. For now, I'm just
                                going to add some screenshots and a brief
                                description of each.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                First, we give our div a base style:
                            </p>
                            <img src="./images/blog-post-11-18-23-CSS.png"
                                alt="A screenshot of the CSS to style the div"
                                class="code-screenshots">
                            <p>
                                Then, in our JavaScript file, we select the
                                div using querySelector,
                                and, once we have it assigned to a variable,
                                add an event listener.
                                Note that I'm using an anonymous function to
                                call the randomization
                                functions when the div is clicked.
                            </p>
                            <img
                                src="./images/blog-post-11-18-23-selector.png"
                                alt="A screenshot of the JavaScript code to add an event listener to the div."
                                class="code-screenshots">
                            <p>
                                And, here are the functions that are
                                actually returning the
                                randomized styles. In the first one, I'm
                                construction an RGB code
                                (as a string) by randomizing each of the
                                values and using a template
                                literal to put them all together. The second
                                function does basically
                                the same thing, but I'm randomizing a border
                                size (up to 10 pixels),
                                and border style (chosen from the array of
                                strings), and a color
                                created using selectRandomColor().
                            </p>

                                The CSS <em>transform</em> property allows
                                us to manipulate an HTML
                                element in a variety of ways. Specifically,
                                we can rotate, skew,
                                move, and scale elements. The full spectrum
                                of transforms is
                                extensive, so I'll address each of the
                                transform values in
                                individual posts.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Today, we'll begin with rotations, and to
                                demonstrate, we'll start
                                with a simple div:
                            </p>
                            <div class="blog-example-11-08-23"
                                id="normal-div">
                                EXAMPLE
                            </div>

                            <p>
                                Which we can create by first making a div
                                and styling it like so:
                            </p>

                            <img class="code-screenshots"
                                src="./images/blog-post-11-08-23-div.png"
                                alt="A screenshot of the CSS to style the div.">
                            <p>
                                Now, what if, for whatever reason, we wanted
                                to flip that div over?
                                Enter CSS transform and the <em>rotate</em>
                                value:
                            </p>

                            <img class="code-screenshots"
                                alt="A screensht of the code to rotate a div."
                                src="./images/blog-post-11-08-23-rotated.png">
                            <p>
                                And, <em>voila!</em> We now have a div
                                standing on its head:
                            </p>

                            <div class="blog-example-11-08-23"
                                id="rotated-div">
                                EXAMPLE
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                But that's just the beginning. What if we
                                wanted the element to spin
                                around, and we wanted it to happen when we
                                mouse over it?
                                All we need to do is give it a degree
                                argument greater than 360 (a
                                full rotation) with the <i>hover</i>
                                pseudo-class. We'll give a
                                transition to make it look nicer as well:
                            </p>
                            <img class="code-screenshots"
                                src="./images/blog-post-11-08-23-spinning.png"
                                alt="a screenshot of the code to create a spinning div.">
                            <p>
                                Now trying hovering your mouse over the div
                                to see how it responds.
                            </p>
                            <div class="blog-example-11-08-23"
                                id="spinning-div">
                                EXAMPLE
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Pretty neat! Now, take note of the fact that
                                in both of these
                                examples, we've used positive value for the
                                degrees of rotation,
                                which rotates the div clockwise. Using a
                                negative number for our
                                degrees will rotate the div in the opposite
                                direction:
                            </p>

                                There are numerous other things that can be
                                done with rotations,
                                including rotating along the X or Y axes
                                specifically, or specifing
                                turns rather than degrees. But this is
                                enough to get you started. To
                                delve deeper, I suggest <a

                                To display tabular data, such as you might find
                                in an excel
                                spreadsheet or Pandas dataframe, in HTML, we
                                (shockingly) use a
                                <em>table</em>.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Enclosed within the &lt;table&gt; tag, we define
                                headers with the
                                table header tag &lt;th&gt;, ordinary rows with
                                table rows
                                &lt;tr&gt;, and cell values with &lt;td&gt;
                                (table data).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For instance, let's say we wanted to display
                                some current stock
                                market information. We could use the following
                                code:
                            </p>
                            <img class="code-screenshots"
                                src="./images/table_code_screenshot.png"

                            <p>
                                Which gives us the following table:
                            </p>
                            <table>

                                </tr>
                            </table>
                            <p>
                                A couple of things to to note here. First, table
                                data &lt;td&gt;
                                is
                                nested within each table row &lt;tr&gt;, which
                                is nested with the
                                table tags. And second, our top row is defined
                                not with table data
                                tags, but with table header tags &lt;th&gt;.
                                Also, notice that
                                there
                                are two empty header tags. As headers are
                                aligned with columns, we
                                need those there to make sure the change and PCT
                                change headers
                                are
                                place over the appropriate columns.

                                One of the main topics covered this week is the
                                addition of audio
                                and
                                video files into web pages. As common as
                                multimedia is on the
                                modern
                                web, it's not as simple as adding an &lt;img&gt;
                                tag for images.
                                First, not all browsers support the same
                                <a
                                    href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchunifiedcommunications/definition/codec">codecs</a>,
                                so it becomes necessary to provide multiple file
                                types(e.g. having
                                a video file provided in both .mp4 and .webm).
                                Additionally, since
                                some older browsers don't support HTML5, which
                                introduces native
                                multimedia, we must also add an error message
                                for this scenario.
                                So,
                                beginning with the base &lt;audio&gt; and
                                &lt;video&gt; tags, this
                                ends up looking something like this:
                            </p>

                            <img class="code-screenshots"
                                src="./images/audio_video_screenshot.png"
                                alt="A screenshot of the code for HTML5 audio and video.">

                            <p>Which gives us this:</p>
                            <audio controls>
                                <source src="./audio/viper.mp3">
                                <source src="./audio/viper.ogg">
                                Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio.

                            <video preload controls>

                            </video>

                            <p>
                                Note also the attribute used: <em>controls</em>
                                tells the browser
                                to
                                render the controls for the file. Control
                                buttons are not
                                displayed
                                by
                                default, so this attribute is necessary for the
                                user to be able to
                                play or stop the playback. Other attributes
                                include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                                    autoplay - applies to both video an audio
                                    and indicates that the
                                    file shoule start playing automatically.
                                </li>

                                    preload - applies to both video and audio
                                    and inidcates what the
                                    browser should do if autoplay is not
                                    enabled. It can take the
                                    following values:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            none - browser should not load the
                                            file until the user
                                            presses
                                            play
                                        </li>
                                        <li>auto - browser downloads the video
                                            when the page loads</li>
                                        <li>
                                            metadata - browser collects metadata
                                            like size, duration and
                                            track list
                                        </li>

                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    width and height - determines the size that
                                    a video is rendered
                                    in
                                    the browser.
                                </li>

                                I've considered starting a blog numerous times
                                in the past. I love
                                to
                                write (so much so that I did a completely

                                discipline to do it regularly.

                                we are tasked with
                                creating a portfolio site as a term project,
                                which seems to me to
                                be
                                the perfect impetus to actually get it together
                                and do this thing.
                                So,
                                I'm setting the following goal:
                                <i>With each assignment (each iteration of the
                                    project), I will
                                    add
                                    at
                                    least one blog post highlighting something
                                    that I've learned
                                    within
                                    that module.</i>
                                Realistically, I'll probably cut myself some
                                slack as finals
                                approach, though.
                            </p>
                            <p>Time to get to work!</p>
